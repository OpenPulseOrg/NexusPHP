 * This code defines various configuration settings used for storing sensitive keys and data, such as encryption keys,
 * nonces, API keys, and any other sensitive information that needs to be securely stored. These settings are returned as an associative array.
 * The keys config file is typically used to centralize and manage all the sensitive keys and data used by an application.
 * It provides a convenient way to store and access these keys in a secure manner, separate from the main codebase. This
 * helps in maintaining good security practices and facilitates easy key rotation if required.
 *
